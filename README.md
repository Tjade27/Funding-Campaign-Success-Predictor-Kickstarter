# Second Project - Project Lifecycle (neuefische)

This is my second big project in the datascience bootcamp of neuefische GmbH.
It is centered around working through the whole Data Science Lifecycle, especially the implementation and evaluation of several machine learning algorithms on the given problem.

### 1. [Task Description](https://github.com/Tjade27/second_project/blob/main/2_Project_LifeCycle.pdf)
This is the task description handed to me by the coaches of neuefische GmbH. 

### 2. [Raw Data](https://github.com/Tjade27/second_project/tree/main/data)
This is the directory with the untouched data to work with. It includes the metadata for over 200000 Kickstarter projects.

### 3. [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/Tjade27/second_project/blob/main/Project%202%20-%20Kickstarter%20Campaign%20Success%20Predictor.ipynb)
This is the organized and commented Jupyter Notebook in which all the steps of the Data Science Lifecycle are covered to solve the task of training and evaluating several machine learning algorithms in order to predict, wether a Kickstarter project campaign will be successful or not.

### 4. [Presentation](https://github.com/Tjade27/second_project/blob/main/Project%202%20-%20Kickstarter%20Presentation.pdf)
This is the presentation that I held to showcase some interesting findings as well as my results.
